# Replit Prompt: Consolidate Paired Registrations into Single Comprehensive Services

---

## 1. Identify and Group Complementary Registrations That Form Natural Pairs

- For registrations that logically belong together (e.g., Add Director / Remove Director), consolidate them into **one single service** reflecting both actions, with a combined, user-friendly name.

### Examples:

| Current Separate Registrations           | Consolidated Service Name           |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Add a Director, Remove a Director       | Director Management                |
| Increase Authorized Capital, Decrease Authorized Capital (if any) | Authorized Capital Changes        |
| Add Designated Partner, Remove Designated Partner (if any) | Designated Partner Management     |
| Close the Pvt Ltd Company, Strike Off Company | Company Closure & Strike Off      |

- Review all services/registrations across the site (header navigation, landing page, More dropdown, mobile menu, service list pages) to identify such pairs and consolidate accordingly.
- For any service currently only having one side (e.g., "Add Director" only), propose adding the complement ("Remove Director") or create a general combined category for future additions.

## 2. Implementation Details

- Replace multiple paired links with a **single navigation entry** linking to a combined service page or listing.
- Update service page content to include both actions under one umbrella with clear subsections for adding/removing, increasing/decreasing, etc.
- Adjust all route paths and slugs accordingly (e.g., `/services/director-management` instead of separate add/remove director routes).
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing URLs by adding redirects where necessary.

## 3. UI/UX and Consistency

- Throughout the platform (header, dropdowns, mobile menus), show the consolidated service as a single option.
- Update documentation, breadcrumbs, and SEO/meta tags to reflect the new consolidated naming.
- On the service page, present add/remove instructions clearly, perhaps with tabs or collapsible sections for each action.

---

## 4. Testing & QA

- Test all combined links to ensure routing works correctly.
- Validate that legacy individual pages redirect or are merged into the combined page.
- Confirm no navigation duplication or confusion remains post consolidation.

**Summary:**
Scan the entire service and registration listings for complementary add/remove or increase/decrease pairs. Consolidate each pair into one unified, clear service with combined content and navigation, refactor routes, and globally update navigation UI for consistency and better user experience.
