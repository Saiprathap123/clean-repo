# Replit Implementation Prompt: Distinct Grey Theme Overhaul & Email Notification Testing

---

## 1. Theme Overhaul: Switch Entire Site to a Distinct, Layered Grey Palette

You must update the **entire color scheme** – background, cards, text, buttons, all UI elements – to a visually differentiated, layered dark grey theme. **It should be obviously different from black and create a contemporary, high-contrast professional feel.**

### a) Adopt This Color Palette (use hex codes directly or in Tailwind config):

- **Main background:** `#282A2E` (deep slate grey)
- **Section alternate bg:** `#313338` (lighter grey for alternating sections or hero)
- **Card and Surface bg:** `#363940`
- **Navigation bar / Footer:** `#222327`
- **Borders & Dividers:** `#45474D`
- **Panel highlights:** `#393B41`
- **Primary Headings (`h1`, `h2`):** `#F5F6FA` (nearly white)
- **Body Text:** `#DCDEE1`
- **Secondary Text:** `#AEB0B8`
- **Button Background:** `#45474D`
- **Button Text:** `#F5F6FA` (white)
- **Button Hover:**  
  - BG: `#F5F6FA` (white)
  - Text: `#282A2E` (slate grey)
- **Input/Field BG:** `#393B41`
- **Input Text:** `#F5F6FA`
- **Accent color (optional, minimal):** `#5b91e1` (soft blue) for links/hover/CTA icons only

### b) Implementation Instructions

- Update `tailwind.config.js`, global CSS, and all page/component bg and card color references with these shades.
- Replace every instance of `bg-black`, `bg-[#0a0a0a]`, `bg-[#232323]`, etc., with `bg-[#282A2E]` for page/main backgrounds.
- Cards, dropdowns, and panels must use `#363940` or `#313338` for clear differentiation.
- Button classes should be:
  ```
  bg-[#45474D] text-[#F5F6FA] border-[#393B41] 
  hover:bg-[#F5F6FA] hover:text-[#282A2E] hover:border-[#45474D] 
  transition-all duration-150 font-semibold rounded-lg
  ```
- Adjust text in all headings and secondary labels as per above palette.
- Visually test the site to ensure every interactive or text-bearing element is legible and visually separated from its background (no muddy mono-grey), and the theme is easy to distinguish from black.

## 2. Test and Fix Email Notification System

- Use the following credentials in your `.env` and backend configuration:
  ```
  BREVO_USER=9284b3002@smtp-brevo.com
  BREVO_PASS=C9QhvHxbLpTn865P
  ```
- On every successful appointment booking, send transactional emails:
  - **To User (from:** `recruitment@dynish.com` **):** Include booking details and meet link.
  - **To Client/Admin:** `pottipatisaiprathap1234@gmail.com`
    - Email summary with all appointment data and the same meet link.
- The "from" address in Nodemailer/sendMail must be `recruitment@dynish.com` (the authenticated sender in Brevo).
- After setting credentials, book a test appointment. Check for delivery at both addresses and log any errors to the console.
- If emails do not arrive:
  - Double-check `.env` (no spaces/quotes), sender verification in Brevo, and domain authentication status.
  - Add a `transporter.verify()` step to log connection/auth success/failure after server starts.

## 3. Final Checklist

- The **theme** must be visually distinct grey layers – no blacks, and each section/panel/button should have perceptible contrast but remain cohesive.
- **Buttons:** Always grey with white text, invert to white with dark text on hover.
- **All UI elements** (inputs, dropdowns, cards, footers, modal backgrounds) use the new grey shades.
- The **email workflow** is live, with booking confirmations sent from `recruitment@dynish.com` to both user and client address, and successful delivery verified.
- Notify if you see any missed black/dark shades or email issues after implementation for immediate revision.

**Proceed with the above grey theme palette and email notification system update. Visually review all pages after updates and run at least one full booking test to verify email delivery.**
