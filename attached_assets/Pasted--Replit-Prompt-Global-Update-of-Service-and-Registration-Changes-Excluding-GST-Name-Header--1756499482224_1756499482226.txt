# Replit Prompt: Global Update of Service and Registration Changes (Excluding GST Name & Header)

---

## Summary
You have already completed global updates for:
- GST name change from “GST & Indirect Taxes” to “GST” everywhere,
- AI floating action button and AI suggestions placement,
- Header navigation updates.

Now please focus on **globally updating all other service and registration changes across the entire site** including:

---

## 1. NGO Services Section
- Remove “NGO Registration” completely.
- Rename “Trust Registration” to “Trust Registration as per Income Tax”.
- Ensure that only **“Trust Registration as per Income Tax”** remains listed under NGO Services globally:
  - Homepage services section
  - Service pages under `client/src/pages/services/`
  - More dropdown menu (desktop and mobile)
  - Booking form services list
  - Any references in meta data, breadcrumbs, or SEO tags

---

## 2. Employee Benefits Section
- Move the following services **from Licenses & Registrations** to **Employee Benefits** section globally:
  - Payroll Compliance
  - Employee Tax Planning
- Move “TDS Returns” from Employee Benefits → Mandatory Annual Filings.
- After moving, update the listings in all applicable places (homepage, menus, booking forms, service detail pages).

---

## 3. Mandatory Annual Filings Section
- Under Mandatory Annual Filings, present the following registrations/services explicitly:
  - ROC
  - GST
  - Income Tax Returns
  - TDS Returns

---

## 4. Other Removals
- Remove “IEC (Import/Export Code)” and “Leave & LTA Policy” completely from Licenses & Registrations globally.

---

## 5. Booking Form Services List
- Ensure the booking form’s service dropdown/select list reflects the updated global taxonomy after all the above moves/removals/renames.
- No outdated or removed services should appear.
- All service slugs route correctly to their corresponding service page or placeholder.

---

## 6. Quality Assurance
- Test on all site sections (homepage, menus, booking form, individual service pages) to ensure the updated services and registrations listings are consistent, complete, and without duplicates.
- No references to removed services (“NGO Registration”, “IEC”, “Leave & LTA Policy”, etc.) should remain anywhere.
- The renamed and moved services must display the updated names and placements everywhere.

---

## Final Note
**Do NOT update GST names or header navigation as these are fully done.**  
**Focus on the full site content updates ONLY for NGO, Employee Benefits, Mandatory Filings, Licenses & Registrations, booking form, and service pages.**

Please perform a full global synchronization of these service/registration changes urgently and confirm once fully and correctly applied.
