# Replit Development Prompt: Services Alignment, Header More Grid, and Mobile Responsiveness

---

## 1. Strictly Use Provided Services and Registrations

- **Update the landing page "Services" section** so that it displays only the exact services (and registration types under each) you provided—matching the canonical order and naming from your master list.
    - Remove all placeholder or unrelated service cards.
    - For each displayed service on the landing:
        - **Header:** Service name as specified in your list.
        - **Description:** SEO-friendly summary (optionally paraphrased, but accurate to client context).
        - **Include links** to individual service page (not generic, but from your supplied list).
    - **Navigation:** Clicking a card or link should navigate to the corresponding service as you defined.
    - **Do not create or display pages for any service or registration not in your official list.**

## 2. Header "More" Dropdown as Responsive Grid

- Refactor the "More" dropdown in the site header:
    - Instead of a long vertical column, **organize all services and types of registrations into a 2×2 (or multi-column) responsive grid layout.**
    - This enriches the UI, improves scan-ability, and looks more professional.
    - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout, with appropriate gaps and responsive breakpoints for smaller screens.
- Each item in the grid should be:
    - **Clickable**, with a clear label (service/registration name).
    - Consistently styled with your dark theme and hover/focus states.

## 3. Perfect Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness

- **Make the mobile/tablet header menu fully scrollable:**
    - If there is a scroll overflow in the mobile menu (hamburger icon/3-lines), ensure you use CSS properties like `overflow-y-auto` or `scrollable` on the menu container, so users can scroll to see all services and registrations.
    - Test the menu with several services open—users must be able to reach every link, no matter the number.
- On mobile:
    - Ensure tap/click targets are large enough.
    - The grid in the "More" dropdown should stack gracefully (e.g., 1 column or 2 columns depending on width).
- Test across standard screen widths for header/nav, dropdowns, and service navigation, maintaining usability and visual polish.

## 4. SEO Optimization Instructions

- When updating the "Services" section and header, use:
    - `<h2>` for each service name.
    - Short, keyword-rich but natural descriptions.
    - Semantic HTML for lists/links to registrations (e.g., `<ul>` and `<li>`).
    - Ensure `alt` text on icons or thumbnail images.
    - Keep navigation and section headers clear for search engines.

## 5. Implementation Notes

- **Do not alter content of registration or service detail pages unless further SEO enhancements are required in subsequent tasks.**
- All updates should preserve the visual theme, responsiveness, and accessibility.
- After these core changes, test the site on desktop, tablet, and mobile views to ensure navigation, service discovery, and menu dropdowns are seamless and user-friendly.

**Proceed to:**
1. Update the landing page services to your provided list/order only.
2. Refactor the header "More" dropdown into a rich, responsive grid.
3. Ensure full scroll-ability and usability of navigation on mobile/tablet, especially the full services list within the menu.

After implementing, review in multiple viewports. Ready for further refinement upon request.
