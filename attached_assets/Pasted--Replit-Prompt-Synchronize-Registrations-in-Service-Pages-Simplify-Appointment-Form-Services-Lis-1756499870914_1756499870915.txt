# Replit Prompt: Synchronize Registrations in Service Pages & Simplify Appointment Form Services List

---

## 1. Update Individual Service Pages Registrations

- For all major service category pages (e.g., NGO Services, Employee Benefits, Licenses & Registrations, etc.) under `client/src/pages/services/`:
  - **Remove or update registration lists** inside these pages to reflect the latest global taxonomy.
  - Example:  
    - NGO Services page should show only **one registration**: "Trust Registration as per Income Tax" (no old registrations like NGO Registration or others).
    - Employee Benefits, Licenses sections, etc., must match current service listings exactly.
  - The "Learn More" links on the homepage or navigation should land on pages with **correct, updated registrations only**â€”no outdated or removed entries.

- Verify consistency of registration lists and descriptions inside each individual page with the global updated service taxonomy.

## 2. Simplify Appointment Booking Form Services List

- **Remove registrations from the appointment booking form's service select/dropdown list.**
- Instead of showing individual registrations, show only the **main service categories** (total 8 services), for example:  
  1. Business Registration  
  2. GST  
  3. Licenses & Registrations  
  4. NGO Services  
  5. Accounting & Tax  
  6. Mandatory Annual Filings  
  7. Changes in Private Limited Company  
  8. Employee Benefits  

- This simplifies the user experience when booking appointments by presenting broad service categories rather than detailed registrations.

## 3. Global Consistency & QA

- Ensure these updates reflect on all devices and in all relevant UI components:
  - Homepage service detail pages
  - Header navigation dropdown pages
  - Booking modal/service select form
  - Mobile menus and More dropdown

- Test all navigation links and booking form service list behavior for correctness and user-friendliness.

**Summary:**  
Update all individual service pages to show only their current valid registrations.  
Simplify appointment booking service list to display main service categories only, removing detailed registrations from booking form.  
Ensure full site-wide consistency with the latest taxonomy definitions and test navigation thoroughly.
