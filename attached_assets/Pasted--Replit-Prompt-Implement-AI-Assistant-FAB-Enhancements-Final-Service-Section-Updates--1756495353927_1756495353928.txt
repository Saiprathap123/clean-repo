# Replit Prompt: Implement AI Assistant FAB Enhancements & Final Service Section Updates

---

## 1. AI Floating Action Button Enhancement  
- Enhance existing AI floating button (bottom-right/side) to increase visibility and clarity for new users:  
  - Add a **text label “AI Assistant”** next to or above the button.  
  - Add a **subtle pulsing/glowing animation** around the button using CSS to draw attention smoothly.  
  - Implement a **one-time dismissible welcome popup** for first-time visitors:  
    - Displays near the FAB or centered on screen.  
    - Message: *"Hi! Click the blue AI Assistant button to get personalized service recommendations."*  
    - Includes a close/dismiss button to prevent repeated annoyance.  
  - Optionally replace the FAB icon with an **animated chat bot icon** that waves or blinks once on page load to suggest interactivity.

## 2. Service Section Updates (GLOBAL - header, landing page, "More" dropdown, mobile menu)  

### a. Employee Benefits  
- **Move** these two from Licenses & Registrations → Employee Benefits service:  
  - Payroll Compliance  
  - Employee Tax Planning  

### b. NGO Services  
- **Remove** "NGO Registration" completely.  
- **Rename** "Trust Registration" to:  
  - "Trust Registration as per Income Tax"  
- Resulting NGO Services section contains only:  
  - "Trust Registration as per Income Tax"

### c. Mandatory Annual Filings  
- **Move** "TDS Returns" from Employee Benefits → Mandatory Annual Filings.  
- **Under Mandatory Filings section, list:**  
  - ROC  
  - GST  
  - Income Tax Returns  
  - TDS Returns

## 3. Apply All Changes Consistently Across the Entire Site  
- Header navigation dropdowns  
- Homepage service sections  
- Mobile menus  
- "More" dropdown categories and registrations  
- Any other service listing or route references  
- Ensure no duplicates, omissions, or mismatches in updated service lists and names.

---

## 4. Final QA  
- Test all navigation links to updated and moved registration services.  
- Confirm AI Assistant FAB is highly visible, animated, and the welcome popup triggers correctly for new visitors and is dismissible.  
- Check styles and responsiveness on desktop and mobile.  
- Make sure no old or removed service entries remain visible anywhere.
