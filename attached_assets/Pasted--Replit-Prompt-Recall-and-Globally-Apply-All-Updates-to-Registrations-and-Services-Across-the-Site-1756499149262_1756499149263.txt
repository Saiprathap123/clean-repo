## Instructions for Replit

- **Scan all relevant files and sections:** header navigation, landing page services section, individual service pages in `client/src/pages/services/`, mobile nav, More dropdowns, booking form services list (likely `BookingModal.tsx`).
- **Update all references in text, navigation arrays, routing, and page content** to reflect these changes globally.
- **Ensure consistency** in service naming, order, and inclusion/exclusion across all site areas.
- **Create or consolidate pages for any newly merged or renamed services**, maintaining existing routes with redirects if needed.
- **Test thoroughly** that rendered service lists, navigation menus, and booking form options are fully up-to-date site-wide.
- **Fix any broken or missing routes** for affected services and registrations.
- Use the updated **header navigation data as the single source of truth**.

**Urgency:**  
Complete these global updates coherently and fully. Partial updates only in the header are insufficient. Deliver a consistent, polished, and fully synchronized CA platform with all changes fully implemented everywhere.

**Confirm completion with a detailed report of updated files and tested sections.**
