## 2. Create Missing Service & Registration Pages

**Action:**  
For all top-level services not already having a service page (inspired by your Business Registration example), create:
- A **service landing page** with:
  - Service title (as ``)
  - SEO-optimized overview (1–2 paragraphs with relevant CA/finance keywords)
  - Bullet points or sections for:
    - Applicability / Ideal For
    - Key Benefits
    - List of registrations offered under this service (each a clickable link)
  - Any FAQ or CTA as seen on the Business Registration service page

- For each registration under every service:
  - A dedicated registration page (if not already), preserving all client-supplied information and rewritten/structured for SEO, without changing context or omitting client-required facts.

**Services to Confirm/Create Pages For:**
- Licenses & Registrations
- NGO Services
- Accounting & Taxing
- Mandatory Annual Filings
- Changes in Private Limited Company
- Changes in Limited Liability Partnership
- Employee Benefits

## 3. Navigation & Testing

**Action:**  
- Ensure all new service and registration pages are properly linked:
    - From the landing page services section
    - From the top/side navigation and any "More" dropdowns in the header
    - Clicking any registration in any service nav goes to the corresponding registration page
- Test all navigation on desktop, tablet, and mobile (responsive)
- No broken/empty routes; all services and pages navigable as per site logic

---

## 4. Layout & Content Consistency

- **Do not invent new layouts**—exactly mirror how "Business Registration" service and its registrations are designed, including headings, CTAs, subtitles, sectioning, and content style for every other service and registration page.
- All new service and registration pages should follow this exact template, with clean SEO markup and structure, high readability, and copy optimized for Google discovery.
