## 1. Global Service Name Change

---

## 2. Business Registration Services Updates
- **Remove**:
  - "Nidhi Company Registration"
  - "Producer Company Registration"
- **Move**:
  - "Section 8 Company Registration" from NGO Services → Business Registration  
    (Appears after "Partnership Firm Registration" in order)

## 4. "More" Tab Enhancements
- In **"Accounting & Tax"** and **"Mandatory Annual Filings"** in More dropdown:
  - List **all individual registrations** explicitly (like we’ve done for other service categories).
  - Accounting & Tax items (confirm from current registry):  
    - Accounting and Book-keeping  
    - TDS Return Filing  
    - Individual Income Tax Filing  
    - Proprietorship Tax Return Filing  
    - ITR for LLP

## 5. Highlight AI Service Recommendations
- **Keep existing AI Service Recommendations button in hero section**.
- Add **new floating action button** (FAB) at bottom-right or side-bottom across all pages:
  - Stays fixed on screen.
  - When clicked, scrolls/jumps to the AI Recommendations section or opens it in a modal.
  - Style to stand out (accent blue background, hover animation).

---

## 6. Navigation Page Transition Animation
- Implement a **page route transition animation** (e.g., slide-in or fade+slide) when navigating between pages in Wouter:
  - Animation should be fast (300–500ms) and give visual cue of navigation.
  - Apply globally for all route changes.

---

## 7. Page Load Scroll Position Fix
- Fix navigation so that when moving to any service or registration page:
  - Page loads scrolled to the **top (heading)**, not mid-content.
  - Implement `window.scrollTo(0,0)` on route change in router or useEffect in page components.

## 8. Service Page Content Changes
### Private Limited Company Registration
- In Benefits section:
  - **Remove** "Easy Fundraising" and "Enhanced Credibility" benefit boxes.

### Public Limited Company Registration
- Highlight the advisory text:  
  *"(Public Company Suits Listing Needs; Private Offers Simpler Operations. Private Company Preferred Unless Public Listing is Planned)"*
- Style it as:
  - Prominent banner with contrasting background and accent border.
  - Horizontal scrolling marquee effect (continuous left-to-right, smooth).

### LLP Registration
- Highlight the advisory text:  
  *"Partnership is preferred for ease doing businesses otherwise LLP is preferable"*
- Same treatment as public ltd advisory:
  - Styled banner
  - Horizontal scrolling marquee

---

## 9. Global Application of Changes
- All edits to services/categories must be reflected **globally**:
  - Header navigation
  - More dropdown
  - Mobile menu
  - Landing page services grid
  - Any SEO/meta where applicable

---

## 10. Final QA
- Test all navigation links after updates.
- Verify "AI Service Recommendations" is highly visible (hero + floating button).
- Confirm animations and scroll fixes work seamlessly.
- Ensure removed services no longer appear anywhere.
- Check updated names/structures consistent in desktop & mobile views.

**Goal:** Deliver all changes as a cohesive update, with consistent navigation, improved UX cues, and globally synced service data, ready for client hand-off.
