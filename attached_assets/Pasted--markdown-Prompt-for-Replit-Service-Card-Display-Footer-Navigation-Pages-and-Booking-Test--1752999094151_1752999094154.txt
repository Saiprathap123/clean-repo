# Prompt for Replit: Service Card Display, Footer Navigation Pages, and Booking Test

---

## 1. Limit Registration List in Service Cards

- In the landing page *Services* section, **display only the first 4 registrations under each service card**.
- For all services:  
  - **Show no more than four registration types as a sample underneath the service name**.
  - Below these, include a prominent **"Learn More" button**. Clicking this navigates to the full service page, which lists every related registration and details.
- **Do not show the full list of all registration types directly in the card; avoid visual clutter and keep the section clean and scan-friendly**[4][8][9].

---

## 2. Add Essential Site Pages From Footer Navigation

- **Create the following static pages:**  
    - About Us  
    - Contact Us  
    - Blog
- Link each of these to the relevant nav links in the **footer** (the links are already present).
- **Remove the Pricing link** from the footer.
- Page content:
    - Provide brief, SEO-optimized content sections for About Us, Contact, and Blog home (blog page can have a "coming soon" placeholder if no blogs yet).
    - Ensure these pages are accessible and styled consistently.

## 3. Booking Testing Instructions

- After these UI changes, **request the user’s Brevo SMTP credentials** before fully enabling or testing appointment booking.
    - Clearly display a notice or prompt to the developer/admin (in readme, code comment, or deployment logs) stating:
      > “Please provide your Brevo SMTP username and password in the .env file to conduct end-to-end testing of the appointment booking and email notification feature.”
- Do not attempt booking-related email testing or shipping to production until valid credentials are provided.

## 4. Visual and UX Notes

- With only 4 registrations shown per service card, the landing page appearance will be less cluttered and more engaging for users, while "Learn More" retains deep navigation access[4][9].
- Footer navigation to About, Contact, and Blog improves site SEO and credibility.
- Removing the Pricing page link ensures footer navigation only contains relevant, client-approved pages.

---

**Proceed by:**
- Limiting visible registrations in each service card to four plus a "Learn More" button.
- Creating About, Contact, and Blog pages, and wiring them up in the footer nav, removing the Pricing link.
- Prompting for Brevo credentials before testing any live booking or notifications.
