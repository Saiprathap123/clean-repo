# Replit Prompt: Service Card Color, Service Page Unification, and Client-Requested Changes

---

## 1. Service Card Color Consistency (Home Page – Services Section)

- **Action:** Update all service cards in the “Services” section of the home page so they use the *exact same black color, style, and format* as the reference in the attached image.
    - Every service card must have `bg-black` (or `#161616` as used in the current Accounting & Taxing page), with matching border, shadow, text, and icon styles across all cards.
    - No service card may use a lighter or different background.
    - Ensure hover, active, and selected states also use the black/dark theme.
    - Confirm spacing, corner radius, and padding are visually identical among all service cards.

---

## 2. Service Page Unification

- **Action:** Make all service pages (e.g., Business Registration, Licenses & Registration, etc.) *use the same layout, theme, and section formatting as the "Accounting & Taxing" service page.*
    - Black/dark background on the main page and all cards/sections.
    - Page structure: clear `<h1>` title, intro/overview at top, benefit sections, compliance/required docs as cards or panels, FAQs, and CTAs—replicate the order and style of Accounting & Taxing across every service page.
    - No white or off-theme backgrounds; every section/card uses black-theme colors.
    - Unify font weights, spacing, headings, and interactive elements for seamless experience.
    - Registration detail pages linked from each service must also adopt the unified theme if not already done.

### 1. Private Companies Tab (Page/Card/Section):
   - Add to minimum & compliance requirements:  
     • “Books should be maintained as per income tax act”
   - Benefits:
     • Add “name of the company will be reserved - Registered Name Advantage in Private Limited”
     • Add “helpful in promotion, branding, marketing”

### 2. Public Company Tab:
   - Under definition, insert:  
     • (Public Company Suits Listing Needs; Private Offers Simpler Operations.  
       Private Company Preferred Unless Public Listing is Planned)
   - Remove “CS requirement” from minimum compliance.
   - Remove “Board meetings and AGM” from compliance requirements.
   - Add: “Public company compliances are more than private company”

### 3. LLP Tab:
   - Benefits:  
     • Remove “operational flexibility”
     • Add “registered name advantage”
   - After definition, insert:  
     • “Partnership is preferred for ease doing businesses otherwise LLP is preferrable”

### 4. Remove “One Person Company” Service
   - Delete the service card, all navigation links, and all content/pages for “One Person Company”.

### 5. After LLP Service Card, Insert “CHITS FUNDS COMPANY” Card
   - Create a new card and navigation entry for “CHITS FUNDS COMPANY” immediately after LLP in the services section and header. (Use a placeholder page/content if detailed info is not yet provided.)

### 7. GST Tabs/Registrations:
   - Add a “GST Notices” registration under GST services/pages.

### 8. Licenses & Registration Tab:
   - Remove MSME registration (keep only UDYAM, as they are the same).

### 9. More Services Tab:
   - Ensure “Accounting and Tax,” “Mandatory Filings,” and “Employee Benefit” appear as main top-level tabs; move other items below them.

### 10. Employee Benefits in More Tab:

   - In More, only “Monthly returns,” PF, ESI, PT, and TDS returns are visible.

## 4. Navigation and QA

- Update all relevant navigation sections—header nav, more menus, card links, and footer—to reflect all above changes in order and content.
- Remove/replace any outdated references; double-check for straggling links to deleted services (“One Person Company,” MSME, etc.).
- Confirm every new/adjusted service and registration is accessible via both the Services section and header/nav dropdowns.
- Test all cards, dropdowns, registration links, and service/registration pages for uniform theme and navigation.

---

## 5. Final Visual Audit

- Ensure all requested theme and functional changes apply across desktop and mobile.
- Every service card, service page, input, dropdown, and modal must now match the black/dark theme and new hierarchy.
- All newly requested edits, deletions, and insertions must be visible and functional.

**Proceed to fully implement black theme for all cards, all service pages using the Accounting & Taxing template, and all client-requested changes in text, tabs, registrations, header, and service section order. Visually QA before completion.**
