# Replit Prompt: Final End-to-End Frontend QA Checklist and Testing

---

After recent navigation, layout, color, page, and service structure changes, follow this step-by-step prompt to **fully test and validate the frontend**—ensuring all user flows, navigation, UI, and content are perfect and client-ready.

---

## 1. Service Card & Service Page QA

- **Check the Services section (home/landing page):**
    - All service cards (including BUSINESS REGISTRATION, CHITS FUNDS COMPANY, NGO, etc.) must appear, with matching black background and uniform style.
    - No missing, duplicate, or off-style cards.
    - Hover and focus states are visually consistent for every card.

- **Click each service card:**
    - It should correctly route to the matching service page (e.g., `/services/chits-funds-company` or `/services/licences-registrations`).
    - The service page should use a unified black theme (matching Accounting & Taxing), with correct layout/sections and readable content.
    - No pages render as white or have broken layout.

---

## 2. Navigation Bar & Header

- **All dropdowns open with a solid black background and visible items (no transparency issues).**
- **Each dropdown (Business Registration, GST & Indirect Tax, Licenses & Registration, Blog, More):**
    - Every service and registration displays and links correctly.
    - No missing or broken links; clicking any item routes to a valid, styled page.
    - “CHITS FUNDS COMPANY” is present in all intended locations (dropdown, More, mobile menu) and routes to its own service page.

- **Blog link** is visible in the header and routes to the Blog page.
- **Navigation order** matches client specification (CHITS after LLP, Partnership after Chits, etc.).

---

## 3. More Dropdown & Mobile Navigation

- **All categories in More menu (desktop and mobile) display correct services and registrations as per the latest navigation.tsx data.**
    - Accounting & Tax and Mandatory Annual Filings show all their registrations (not just a single catch-all).
    - Employee Benefits, Changes in Private Limited, Changes in LLP, and NGO Services all present with correct children.
    - No leftover "One Person Company" or "MSME" anywhere.

- **Open mobile menu (hamburger):**
    - Menu styling matches desktop.
    - All links, including nested registrations and categories, work and don’t result in 404s.

---

## 4. Registration Page Routing

- Click every registration (under any service, on More, or in service dropdowns).
    - For every `slug`, confirm the site routes to a real, styled registration or placeholder page.
    - No navigation lands on a 404, error, or blank screen.

---

## 5. Visual Design Consistency

- **Black theme is applied everywhere**: landing, header/nav, all services and their detail pages, forms, cards, and dropdowns.
- **Button and CTA styling**: “Get Started”, “Talk to Expert”, and other major CTAs use the correct button theme.
- **Text is clear and readable** on all backgrounds for all sections.

---

## 6. Other Flows

- **Appointment Booking Modal:** Black/dark styling, correct field colors, and 20-minute limit notice visible.
- **AI Recommendations form:** Inputs and dropdown backgrounds fixed (not transparent), text is fully readable while entering and after selection.

---

## 7. General QA Steps

- Test all of the above on both desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility for major flows.
- If using React Query or dynamic routes, check data loads after navigation and from browser refresh (avoid broken links/routing).

---

## 8. Mark and Fix Any Issues

- As you click through, immediately note and fix any issue:
    - UI/UX mismatches
    - Broken or missing navigation links
    - Wrong styling in any section/card/dropdown
    - Placeholder links missing destination pages

---

**Final Instruction:**  
— Run through every section, link, dropdown, and page as per checklist above.  
— Confirm everything is visually and functionally perfect and client-ready before final signoff.  
— Log or report any issues with navigation, styling, or routing for immediate action.
