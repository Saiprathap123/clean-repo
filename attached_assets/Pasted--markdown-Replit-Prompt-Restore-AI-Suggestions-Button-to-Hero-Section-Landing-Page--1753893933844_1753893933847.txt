# Replit Prompt: Restore AI Suggestions Button to Hero Section (Landing Page)

---

## 1. Problem

- The "AI Suggestions" (or "AI Service Recommendations") button in the hero section of the landing page was replaced by a "Business Resources" (Blog) button after recent navigation changes.
- Client/user now wants the dedicated AI Suggestions button/feature restored to the hero section, exactly as before—while keeping blog access available elsewhere as needed.

---

## 2. Actions Required

- **Review the landing page component (e.g., `Home.tsx`, `Landing.tsx`, or corresponding hero component):**
    - Restore the "AI Suggestions" button in the hero section, using the same style, placement, and logic as the original version.
    - The button should explicitly link to the AI Suggestions feature/page or scroll to the AI Recommendation form/component on the landing page (as implemented previously).

- **Do not remove the Blog/Business Resources link from the header nav** if that was added for navigation—but ensure the hero section remains focused on the AI-powered service recommendation CTA as before.
- If both features are wanted in the hero, you may include two buttons side-by-side, but "AI Suggestions" (or similar original label) must be present and primary.

---

## 3. Navigation Consistency

- Confirm that the landing page "AI Suggestions" function works end-to-end:
    - Button is visible on page load.
    - Clicking navigates to, scrolls to, or opens the AI recommendation feature (not to the blog resource).
    - The navigation bar maintains a Blog link as per broader site navigation, but the hero/landing CTA is for AI Suggestions.

- If the previous logic was replaced or refactored, look up the last working version of the hero section (before recent nav edits) and reintroduce the AI Suggestions button and logic.

---

## 4. Visual and Functional Test

- After updating, reload the landing page:
    - Verify that users see the AI Suggestions button in the hero section, styled as before.
    - Clicking brings up or navigates to the recommendation feature.
    - Blog remains accessible through the nav but does not replace AI Suggestions in the hero.

---

**Summary:**  
Restore the "AI Suggestions" button/feature to the main hero section of the landing page, using the original UI/UX and action, regardless of new Blog/Business Resources nav changes. Test and confirm that landing page calls to action prioritize the AI recommendation journey.
